/**
 * RAW EVENT HANDLER
 *
 * This event handler captures and processes raw Discord gateway events
 * before they are processed by Discord.js. It's primarily used for:
 * - Debugging Discord gateway communication
 * - Logging relationship and presence events
 * - Monitoring specific Discord events that may not be fully supported
 * - Development and troubleshooting purposes
 *
 * The handler only operates when debug mode is enabled in the configuration
 * to avoid unnecessary processing and logging in production environments.
