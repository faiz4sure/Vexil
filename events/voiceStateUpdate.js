/**
 * VOICE STATE UPDATE EVENT HANDLER
 *
 * This event handler processes voice channel state changes for users.
 * It handles two main functionalities:
 * - Stalk logging: Records voice activity for users being stalked
 * - Auto-reconnect: Automatically reconnects the selfbot to voice channels
 *
 * Voice state changes include joining, leaving, and moving between voice channels,
 * as well as mute/deafen status changes. The handler logs these activities
 * for stalked users and manages selfbot voice connection stability.
