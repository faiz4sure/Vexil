/**
 * ANTI-CRASH HANDLER
 *
 * This module provides comprehensive error handling to prevent the selfbot
 * from crashing due to unhandled exceptions and promise rejections.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Catches uncaught exceptions and logs them safely
 * - Handles unhandled promise rejections
 * - Filters and logs warnings appropriately
 * - Maintains bot stability during errors
 * - Logs all errors to file for debugging
 *
 * The anti-crash system ensures the selfbot continues running even when
 * unexpected errors occur, which is crucial for 24/7 operation.
